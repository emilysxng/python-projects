**An assorted collection of projects I made in Python from the resources offered on Harvard's CS50x course! Projects in this repo:**

- DNA: Determines suspects based on a DNA sequence and a database of people's longest STR strands.
- Credit: Takes a credit card number, validates it using a checksum, and returns the type of credit card it is (AMEX, VISA, Mastercard, neither).
- Mario: Prints a pyramid like those in Mario based on user's height input.
- Readability: Returns approximate reading level of text inputted by user.
- World Cup: Simulates a tournament, and predicts each team's chances of winning based on data from previous years.
